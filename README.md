# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis — SQL + Power BI

This project delivers a complete analysis of one year of pizza sales data using SQL for backend exploration and Power BI for interactive dashboarding. The aim is to convert raw transactional data into meaningful business insights covering revenue performance, customer behavior, product trends, and category-level contributions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The dataset spans **January 2015 to December 2015**.  
Using SQL, the data is cleaned, aggregated, and shaped into key performance indicators.  
Power BI is then used to visually narrate the story of sales patterns — showing what sells, when it sells, and how it shapes total revenue.

This project mirrors real-world BI workflows: data extraction → transformation → visualization → insights.
